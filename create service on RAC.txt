1.Creating Service in Oracle RAC :

Step 1: To create a service in Oracle RAC

[oracle@rac1 ~]$ srvctl add service -d orcl -s myservice -r orcl1 -a orcl2 -P BASIC
Here I have created service named myservice with preferred instance orcl1 and available instance orcl2.


[oracle@rac1 ~]$ srvctl status service -d orcl -s myservice
Service myservice is not running.
We can see here service is not running. By default, service is not started. We need to start it

[oracle@rac1 ~]$ srvctl start service -d orcl -s myservice
Now, lets check the status of service :

[oracle@rac1 ~]$ srvctl status service -d orcl -s myservice
Service myservice is running on instance(s) orcl1
[oracle@rac1 ~]$
Check service configuration :

[oracle@rac1 ~]$ srvctl config service -d orcl -s myservice

2. Modifying service 

[oracle@rac1 ~]$ srvctl modify service -d orcl -s myservice -P NONE
Now letâ€™s check service with config command

[oracle@rac1 ~]$ srvctl config service -d orcl -s myservice

3. Deleting Service :

[oracle@rac1 ~]$ srvctl remove service -d orcl -s myservice
PRCR-1025 : Resource ora.orcl.myservice.svc is still running
We got an error while deleting service, as service is still running on the orcl1 instance. So we need to first stop it and then try removing it.

[oracle@rac1 ~]$ srvctl stop service -d orcl -s myservice
[oracle@rac1 ~]$ srvctl remove service -d orcl -s myservice
