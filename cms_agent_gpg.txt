What has been done ON gpg.

Login to server as gpg user. Password: cJHwwL9z
check if there are encryption keys
cd gpghome/bin

set environment by running:

./libgpgora.env

 

gpg --list-keys

Delete Current encryption keys
gpg --delete-key cms_test_enc_key


Generate encryption keys
gpg --gen-key file_wallet

gpg --gen-key password _wallet

gpg --gen-key backup

gpg --gen-key CardSuite

 

The password/pass phrase use for all the above keys is Pass12345#

● file_wallet – for encrypting online system old archived data (exported and deleted from the

Oracle Database)

● password_wallet – for password encryption in password.gpg file

● backup – for backup purpose

● CardSuite –for MPCS decryption which public part must be given to outer systems.

 

Restart gpg
cd gpghome/bin

     ./gpg_agent_stop.sh

    ./gpg_agent_start.sh

    ./listener_stop.sh

    ./listener_start.sh

  

When keys are generated, their passphrases (phrases that allow access to the keys) must be entered in the gpg-agent that holds passphrases in the RAM. For decryption private key is stored in the safe place and only access to it is using a Passphrase. Only Administrator knows a Passphrase and Card Suite modules can not decrypt files by themselves.         

              preset-passphrase.sh file_wallet

              preset-passphrase.sh password_wallet

              preset-passphrase.sh backup

              preset-passphrase.sh CardSuite

 

When you run above, for passphrase part 1 put Pass and Part 2 put 12345#
